# Dogs vs Cats Classifier

This app is a simple deep learning project that classifies images of dogs and cats.  
It uses a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model to predict whether an uploaded image belongs to a dog or a cat.  
The project is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for easy access and testing.
